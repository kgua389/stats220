# __My meme__ 

## Why did I create this meme? 
#### *I created this meme because I highly dislike dogs of this breed. I am not a racist. Just this one breed of dog in particular, due to their face and overly aggressive high pitched barks for no reason. To where I've got the inspiration and idea I would give credit to my neighbours dog.*ðŸ˜‚

### About me __(who asked)__ 
- *I dont like rat dogs*
- *I like cats*
- *If I could own a pet, it would be a turtle* 




### And here is my amazing meme:
